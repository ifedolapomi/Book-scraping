# Book-scraping

## Overview
This project uses Power Query to scrape and clean data from a website. The scraped data is cleaned and transformed for analysis directly in Excel.

## How It Works
Data Extraction: Power Query connects to the target website using the From Web option to pull in data.
Data Cleaning: Basic transformations like removing unnecessary columns, adjusting data types, and filtering rows were done in Power Query.
